# PID-Controller-for-Robocon-2016
A robot without any power source to move it forward, one that can only steer itself on a track full of tricky turns, hills and slopes requires a robust control system. This is a PID(Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller which sits at the heart of the control mechanism of such a bot.

Bot Details:
The bot which we call the eco-bot had no power source to drive it according to rules. Another robot was supposed to push it without any physical contact(using either wind or magnetism). The eco-bot could only steer itself on the given track, an image of which can be foung in this repo.

Code:
This repo contains the code for the PID controller that was used to steer the bot on the track. It is an Arduino(.ino) file. We had used Arduino Mega 2560 for this bot.
